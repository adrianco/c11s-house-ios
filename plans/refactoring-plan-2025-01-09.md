# C11S House iOS - Code Refactoring Plan
*Generated: 2025-01-09*
*Hive Mind Analysis by Queen Coordinator*
*Last Updated: 2025-07-10 - Progress Update*

## 🧹 Executive Summary

The codebase is functional but has significant architectural issues. The main problem is **ConversationView.swift (622 lines!)** doing too much, combined with scattered business logic and tight coupling. This plan addresses these issues while keeping NotesService as the unified persistent memory system.

### 📊 Progress Update (2025-07-10)
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (100%)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (100%) 
- **Phase 3**: 🔄 In Progress (60%)
- **Overall**: ConversationView reduced from 622 to 337 lines (45.8% reduction)

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Massive ConversationView (622 lines)**
- **Problem**: Handles UI, business logic, question management, address parsing, and more
- **Impact**: Hard to maintain, test, and reason about

### 2. **Code Duplication**
- **Problem**: House name generation and address parsing duplicated across files
- **Impact**: Risk of inconsistent behavior

### 3. **Threading Complexity**
- **Problem**: ConversationRecognizer uses complex threading with magic error codes
- **Impact**: Potential race conditions and unclear error handling

### 4. **ServiceContainer Overreach**
- **Problem**: Creating ViewModels instead of just managing services
- **Impact**: Violates dependency injection principles

## 🛠️ Detailed Refactoring Plan

### **Phase 1: Extract Business Logic from Views** ✅ COMPLETE

#### 1.1 Create `QuestionFlowCoordinator` ✅
```swift
// New file: Services/QuestionFlowCoordinator.swift
class QuestionFlowCoordinator: ObservableObject {
    private let notesService: NotesServiceProtocol
    
    // Move question flow logic from ConversationView
    // Handle question progression and validation
    // Coordinate with NotesService for persistence
}
```
**Status**: Created and fully integrated. Now handles `saveAnswer()` and `handleQuestionChange()` methods.

#### 1.2 Create `AddressManager` ✅
```swift
// New file: Services/AddressManager.swift
class AddressManager {
    // Consolidate address parsing and validation
    // Handle address detection
    // Generate house names from addresses
    // Still saves to NotesService for persistence
}
```
**Status**: Created and integrated. Now uses AddressParser utility for all parsing logic.

#### 1.3 Create `ConversationStateManager` ✅
```swift
// New file: ViewModels/ConversationStateManager.swift
class ConversationStateManager: ObservableObject {
    // Extract complex state logic from ConversationView
    // Handle transcript management
    // Coordinate TTS playback
    // Manage recording state
}
```
**Status**: Created and enhanced. Now includes `speakHouseThought()` method.

### **Phase 2: Enhance NotesService as Central Memory** ✅ COMPLETE

#### 2.1 Keep NotesService as-is but add clear documentation ✅
```swift
/*
 * NotesService is the central persistent memory system for the app.
 * It stores all types of notes including Q&A, weather summaries, 
 * house preferences, and will expand to include more note types.
 * Future: Will sync with backend and provide context to AI.
 */
```
**Status**: Documentation preserved. NotesService remains the central memory system.

#### 2.2 Create helper managers that use NotesService ✅
```swift
// These coordinators handle business logic but persist via NotesService
QuestionFlowCoordinator -> NotesService (persistence)
AddressManager -> NotesService (persistence)
WeatherCoordinator -> NotesService (persistence)
```
**Status**: All coordinators properly integrated with NotesService for persistence.

### **Phase 3: Clean Up ConversationView** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

#### 3.1 Extract methods to appropriate coordinators ✅
- Move `loadCurrentQuestion()` → QuestionFlowCoordinator ✅
- Move `detectAndPreloadAddress()` → AddressManager ✅
- Move `handleAddressSaved()` → AddressManager ✅
- Move `generateHouseNameSuggestion()` → AddressManager ✅
- Move `saveAnswer()` → QuestionFlowCoordinator ✅
- Move `handleQuestionChange()` → QuestionFlowCoordinator ✅
- Move `speakHouseThought()` → ConversationStateManager ✅

#### 3.2 Simplify ConversationView to ~200 lines 🔄
```swift
struct ConversationView: View {
    @StateObject private var stateManager: ConversationStateManager
    @StateObject private var questionFlow: QuestionFlowCoordinator
    @StateObject private var recognizer = ConversationRecognizer()
    
    // Just UI and coordination, no business logic
}
```
**Status**: Reduced from 622 to 337 lines (45.8% reduction). Further reduction possible but current size maintains good readability.

### **Phase 4: Infrastructure Improvements**

#### 4.1 Fix ConversationRecognizer error handling
```swift
enum SpeechError {
    case noSpeechDetected
    case recordingError(NSError)
    case cancelled
    
    init(nsError: NSError) {
        switch nsError.code {
        case 1110: self = .noSpeechDetected
        case 1101: self = .recordingError(nsError)
        case 203, 216, 301: self = .cancelled
        default: self = .recordingError(nsError)
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Create ViewModelFactory ✅
```swift
// Move ViewModel creation out of ServiceContainer
class ViewModelFactory {
    private let serviceContainer: ServiceContainer
    
    func makeContentViewModel() -> ContentViewModel
    func makeConversationViewModel() -> ConversationStateManager
}
```
**Status**: Created and integrated. ServiceContainer now focuses solely on service management.

### **Phase 5: Shared Utilities** 🔄 PARTIAL

#### 5.1 AddressParser utility ✅
```swift
// Utilities/AddressParser.swift
struct AddressParser {
    static func parse(_ text: String) -> Address?
    static func generateHouseName(from street: String) -> String
}
```
**Status**: Created with comprehensive address parsing methods. Eliminated duplication across 4 files.

#### 5.2 Create extension for common patterns ⏳
```swift
extension NotesServiceProtocol {
    // Convenience methods that multiple coordinators use
    func getCurrentQuestion() async -> Question?
    func getNextUnansweredQuestion() async -> Question?
}
```
**Status**: Not yet implemented. To be completed in next phase.

#### 5.3 SpeechAuthorizationExtension ✅ (Added)
```swift
// Extensions/SpeechAuthorizationExtension.swift
extension SFSpeechRecognizerAuthorizationStatus {
    var localizedDescription: String { ... }
}
```
**Status**: Created to extract helper methods from ConversationView.

2. **Single source of truth** - NotesService remains central memory
3. **Backend ready** - Easy to add sync when needed
4. **AI context ready** - All notes available for AI conversation context
5. **Testability** - Business logic extracted to testable units
6. **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns
7. **Performance** - Reduced view complexity = faster SwiftUI updates

## 🎯 Key Architecture

```
Views (UI only)
    ↓
Coordinators (Business Logic)
    ↓
NotesService (Persistent Memory)
    ↓
Future: Backend Sync & AI Context
```
