# C11S House iOS - Planning Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains all planning and documentation for the C11S House iOS application - a native Swift application that provides voice-driven interaction with a house consciousness system using Apple Intelligence features.

### Project Vision
Build an intuitive, voice-first iOS application that allows users to interact naturally with their smart home consciousness system, leveraging the latest Apple technologies while maintaining privacy and security.

## Quick Start Guide for Developers

### Prerequisites
- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9+
- iOS 17.0+ deployment target
- Apple Developer account

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/c11s-house-ios.git
   cd c11s-house-ios
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install SwiftLint for code quality
   brew install swiftlint
   
   # Install Ruby gems for Fastlane
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Configure Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Add your API keys and configuration
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

4. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open C11SHouse.xcworkspace
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   - Press âŒ˜+U in Xcode to run all unit tests
   - Ensure all tests pass before making changes

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Create test cases for your feature
   - Run tests to see them fail
   - Implement feature to make tests pass

3. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Request code review from team

## Key Decisions Summary

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+ (no Objective-C)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (primary), UIKit (where necessary)
- **Architecture**: MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)
- **Dependency Injection**: Factory pattern with protocols
- **Networking**: URLSession with async/await
- **Local Storage**: Core Data + UserDefaults
- **Testing**: XCTest + Quick/Nimble

### Design Principles
1. **Voice-First**: Every feature must be accessible via voice
2. **Privacy-Focused**: Minimize data collection, maximize on-device processing
3. **Offline-Capable**: Core functions work without internet
4. **Accessible**: Full VoiceOver and accessibility support
5. **Testable**: Minimum 90% code coverage

### Integration Points
- **Backend API**: RESTful + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Apple Services**: Siri, Shortcuts, HomeKit, HealthKit
- **Analytics**: Privacy-preserving, on-device metrics
- **Crash Reporting**: Minimal, anonymized data only

### Security Requirements
- All API communications over HTTPS
- Certificate pinning for backend connections
- Biometric authentication for sensitive operations
- Encrypted local storage for user data
- No third-party tracking SDKs
