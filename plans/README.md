## üéØ Core Technologies and Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+ (no Objective-C)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (primary), UIKit (where necessary)
- **Architecture**: MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)
- **Dependency Injection**: Factory pattern with protocols

- **Local Storage**: Core Data + UserDefaults
- **Testing**: XCTest + Quick/Nimble

### Design Principles
1. **Voice-First**: Every feature must be accessible via voice
2. **Privacy-Focused**: Minimize data collection, maximize on-device processing
3. **Offline-Capable**: Core functions work without internet
4. **Accessible**: Full VoiceOver and accessibility support
5. **Testable**: Minimum 85% code coverage

### Integration Points
- **Backend API**: RESTful + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Apple Services**: Siri, Shortcuts, HomeKit, Speech Recognition
- **Analytics**: Privacy-preserving, on-device metrics
- **Security**: Encrypted communication, biometric authentication
