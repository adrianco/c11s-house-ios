# Test Progress Update

## Current Status

Good progress has been made on the test fixes:

### âœ… Improvements Made

1. **Some ConversationView tests are now passing** - Navigation is working and the view is loading
2. **UI test improvements implemented**:
   - Fixed text field detection by waiting for it after muting
   - Made tests more flexible (accepts either welcome message or questions)
   - Improved mute button detection with multiple identifiers
   
3. **NotesService deadlock fixed** - Removed recursive lock acquisition in loadFromUserDefaults

### ðŸ”„ Still Investigating

1. **Threading test crash** - testConcurrentUIOperations still showing "Must be called on main thread" error
2. **NotesService concurrent saves** - Still failing but deadlock is fixed

## Test Results Summary

### ConversationViewUITests
- **Passing**: Some tests (exact count not specified)
- **Failing**: Tests that expect text fields but app is in voice mode
- **Fixed**: Navigation detection, flexible message detection

### NotesServiceTests  
- **Issue**: Concurrent saves still returning nil
- **Fixed**: Deadlock from recursive lock acquisition
- **Next**: May need different synchronization approach

### ThreadingSafetyUITests
- **Still failing**: testConcurrentUIOperations with main thread violation
- **Need to investigate**: Where the background thread call is coming from

## Key Insights

1. **App defaults to voice mode** - Many UI tests fail because they expect text fields that only appear after muting
2. **ConversationView shows questions** - Not a welcome message, which caused test failures
3. **Simple NSLock may not be enough** - For NotesService concurrent operations

## Next Steps

1. Find and fix the remaining main thread violation in threading tests
2. Consider alternative approach for NotesService concurrency (serial queue?)
3. Update remaining tests to handle voice mode default state
