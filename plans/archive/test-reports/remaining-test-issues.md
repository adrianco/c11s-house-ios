# Remaining Test Issues After Initial Fixes

## Summary
After implementing the initial fixes, some test failures persist. These appear to be different from the original threading and detection issues.

## Current Test Status

### 1. ConversationViewUITests (Still Failing)
- **Issue**: Tests are failing at line 272 even with updated navigation
- **Possible causes**:
  - The app might not be navigating to ConversationView at all
  - The UI elements we're checking for might have different identifiers
  - The `--skip-onboarding` flag might not be working correctly

### 2. NotesService Concurrent Tests (Still Failing)
- **Issue**: Still seeing failures for concurrent saves despite NSLock
- **Error**: `XCTAssertEqual failed: ("nil") is not equal to ("Optional("Concurrent answer 0")")`
- **Already applied**: NSLock to both saveNote() and loadNotesStore()
- **Possible cause**: The lock might need to be applied to loadFromUserDefaults() as well

### 3. Other Test Failures (Not Yet Addressed)
- Archived test files (ConversationFlowIntegrationTests, InitialSetupFlowTests)
- ErrorViewTests conversion test
- OnboardingUITests

## Debugging Steps Needed

### For ConversationViewUITests:
1. Run a single test with debug output to see what elements are actually visible
2. Check if the navigation is happening at all
3. Verify the app launch arguments are working

### For NotesService:
1. The concurrent test might be checking for exact answer values
2. May need to ensure the entire read-modify-write cycle is atomic

## Next Steps

1. **Add more comprehensive locking to NotesService**:
   - Apply lock to all methods that read or write the store
   - Consider using a serial queue instead of NSLock

2. **Add better debug output to UI tests**:
   - Print the full view hierarchy when navigation fails
   - Add screenshots on failure
   - Check if the app is in the expected state

3. **Consider test-specific workarounds**:
   - Add a test-only navigation method that bypasses normal flow
   - Use accessibility identifiers that are more reliable
   - Add explicit waits after navigation

## Notes

- The build errors have been fixed
- The threading violations in UI operations have been resolved
- The basic structure of fixes is correct, but may need refinement
- Some tests might have additional issues beyond what we initially identified
