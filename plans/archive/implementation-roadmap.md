## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Backend API Stability**
   - Risk: Consciousness API changes or downtime
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling, offline mode, and API versioning

2. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**
   - Risk: Poor recognition in noisy environments
   - Mitigation: Multiple input methods, noise cancellation, custom vocabulary training

3. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Risk: User data exposure through voice commands
   - Mitigation: On-device processing, encrypted communications, clear privacy controls

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Feature additions delaying launch
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP definition, phased feature rollout

2. **Third-party Dependencies**
   - Risk: Breaking changes in external libraries
   - Mitigation: Version pinning, abstraction layers, regular updates

3. **Resource Availability**
   - Risk: Key team member unavailability
   - Mitigation: Knowledge documentation, pair programming, cross-training
