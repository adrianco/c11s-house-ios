# Location Services & Weather Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the planned enhancements to the C11S House iOS application to add location-based features and weather integration specifically for the ContentView.

## Key Features Added to Plans

### 1. Address Management System

**User Flow:**
1. App detects user's current location (with permission)
2. Performs reverse geocoding to lookup street address
3. Presents address confirmation dialog
4. User confirms or edits the address
5. Address is saved persistently for future use

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Core Location framework for location services
- Implements CLGeocoder for address lookup
- Stores confirmed address in UserDefaults
- Provides manual address entry as fallback

### 2. Weather Integration on ContentView with WeatherKit

**Features:**
- Real-time weather data display directly on ContentView using Apple's WeatherKit
- Current temperature with "feels like" temperature
- Comprehensive weather conditions (30+ conditions supported)
- Humidity, wind speed, UV index, pressure, visibility, and dew point
- Daily forecast (7 days) and hourly forecast (24 hours)
- Automatic weather updates with native iOS integration

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Apple's WeatherKit framework (iOS 16+)
- No API keys required - uses Apple Developer account
- Native integration with iOS weather services
- Automatic caching and intelligent updates
- Privacy-focused with on-device processing where possible
- Requires WeatherKit entitlement in app capabilities

### 3. House Emotion Weather Reactions

**Weather-Based Emotions with WeatherKit:**
- **Severe Weather** (thunderstorms, hurricane, blizzard): House is very worried (0.9 intensity)
  - "I hope everyone stays safe in this severe weather..."
- **Rain/Drizzle**: House is mildly worried (0.5 intensity)
  - "It's raining. I'll keep everyone cozy and dry."
- **Snow**: House is excited (0.7 intensity)
  - "Snow! How magical. Let's keep warm inside."
- **Clear/Sunny**: House is content (0.7 intensity)
  - "What a beautiful day! Perfect for opening the windows."
- **Hot Weather**: House is tired (0.6 intensity)
  - "It's quite hot. I'll keep the cool air circulating."
- **Frigid Weather**: House is worried (0.7 intensity)
  - "It's freezing outside! I'll work hard to keep you warm."
- **Icy Conditions** (hail, sleet, freezing rain): House is worried (0.8 intensity)
  - "Icy conditions outside. Please be careful!"
- **Cloudy/Foggy**: House is neutral (0.3 intensity)
  - "A bit gloomy outside, but comfortable inside."

### 4. House Name Management

**Name Generation:**
- Automatically suggests house name based on street address
- Removes house number and street type (St, Ave, Rd, etc.)
- Example: "123 Maple Street" â†’ "Maple"

**Storage:**
- House name stored as a note in the NotesService
- Special question: "What is your house's name?"
- User can edit the suggested name or enter custom name

### 5. Weather Summary Notes

**Automatic Weather Logging:**
- Current weather saved as a note after each refresh
- Special question: "What's the current weather like?"
- Comprehensive weather summary including:
  - Temperature, feels-like, and conditions
  - Humidity, wind, UV index, pressure
  - Visibility and dew point
  - 3-day forecast preview
  - Timestamp of last update

**Benefits:**
- House can reference recent weather in conversations
- Weather history available in notes
- Helps track weather patterns over time
- Accessible through Notes view

## Privacy-First Design

**Privacy Features:**
- Lazy permission requests (only when needed)
- Clear explanation before requesting location permission
- Minimal data storage (only confirmed address)
- No location tracking or history
- All processing done on-device where possible

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Setup
1. User opens app for first time
2. App prompts to set home address
3. User grants location permission (optional)
4. App suggests current address
5. User confirms or manually enters address
6. House name is suggested based on street name
7. Weather automatically loads for confirmed location
8. House emotion adjusts based on weather conditions

### Ongoing Usage
1. ContentView displays:
   - House name at top
   - House emotion and thought
   - Current weather widget
   - Voice interface
2. Weather updates automatically in background
3. House emotions react to weather changes
4. User can edit house name through settings

## Integration Points

### ServiceContainer Extensions
```swift
// New services added
locationService: LocationServiceProtocol
weatherService: WeatherServiceProtocol

// Updated ViewModel
makeContentViewModel() // Replaces makeHomeViewModel()
```

### ContentView Components
- `HouseHeaderView` - House name and emotion display
- `WeatherSummaryView` - Weather display widget
- `AddressConfirmationView` - Address confirmation dialog
- `HouseNameEditView` - House name editing interface

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Core Location integration
   - Address lookup and confirmation
   - Basic weather API integration

2. **Medium Priority** (Weeks 3-4)
   - Weather UI components
   - Home view integration
   - Caching and optimization

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Multiple home support
   - Weather-based automation triggers
   - Advanced location features (geofencing, room detection)

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for all services and ViewModels
- UI tests for address confirmation flow
- Integration tests for weather API
- Mock services for testing without network

## Success Criteria

- Seamless address confirmation experience
- Reliable weather updates
- Minimal battery impact
- High user satisfaction with location features
