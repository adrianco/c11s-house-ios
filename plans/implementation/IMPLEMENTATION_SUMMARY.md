- Set up AddressSuggestionService in `setupQuestionFlow()`
- Fixed conversation setup to remove non-existent delegate property

### 5. Enhanced OnboardingPermissionsView
**File**: `/C11Shouse/C11SHouse/Views/Onboarding/OnboardingPermissionsView.swift`
- Added background address lookup after location permission is granted
- Saves detected address to notes for later use in conversation

### 6. Created Tests
**File**: `/C11Shouse/C11SHouseTests/Services/AddressSuggestionServiceTests.swift`
- Comprehensive test coverage for address suggestion functionality
- Tests for house name generation from various street types
- Tests for weather fetch integration
- Mock implementations for testing

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Pre-populated Address Suggestions
- When the address question appears, the app automatically detects the current location
- The detected address is pre-populated in the transcript for user confirmation
- A helpful HouseThought appears asking "I've detected your location. Is this the right address?"

### 2. Intelligent House Name Suggestions
- Based on the confirmed address, the app generates creative house name suggestions
- Examples: "Oak Street" → "Oak House", "Maple Avenue" → "Maple Manor"
- Multiple suggestions are provided with the first one pre-populated

### 3. Automatic Weather Fetch
- After the user confirms their address, weather is automatically fetched in the background
- Weather data is saved as a note for the AI to reference
- The house shows appropriate emotions based on weather conditions

### 4. Background Address Detection
- During the permissions phase, if location permission is granted, address detection happens in the background
- This makes the address question phase feel instant and magical

## User Experience Flow

1. **Permission Phase**: User grants location permission → Background address detection starts
2. **Address Question**: "Is this the right address?" appears with detected address pre-populated
3. **User Confirmation**: User confirms or edits the address → Weather fetch triggered
4. **House Name Question**: "What should I call this house?" with creative suggestions
5. **Weather Integration**: Weather appears on main screen with appropriate house emotion

## Technical Integration Points

- **ServiceContainer**: Provides access to all required services
- **WeatherCoordinator**: Handles weather fetching and emotion determination
- **AddressManager**: Manages address detection and persistence
- **QuestionFlowCoordinator**: Orchestrates the conversation flow
- **ConversationStateManager**: Manages UI state and transcript

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more creative house name generation algorithms
2. Support for apartment/unit numbers in address detection
3. Historical weather tracking for trends
4. Multiple address support for vacation homes
5. Integration with smart home devices based on weather
