## 🎯 Test Strategy

### Mocking Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Mock all dependencies for isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Mock only external APIs (WeatherKit, CoreLocation, Speech)
- **Real Components**: Use actual coordinators and services where possible

### Test Patterns
```swift
// Async/Await Pattern
func testExample() async throws {
    // Given
    let mock = MockService()
    let sut = Coordinator(service: mock)
    
    // When
    try await sut.performAction()
    
    // Then
    XCTAssertTrue(mock.methodCalled)
}

// Thread Safety Pattern
try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
    for i in 0..<100 {
        group.addTask { 
            try await self.sut.concurrentOperation(i)
        }
    }
}
```

## 📈 Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage Areas (80%+)
- AddressParser (100%)
- NotesService (95%)
- Question Flow Logic (90%)
- Address Management (85%)
- Conversation State (80%)

### Medium Coverage Areas (50-79%)
- Weather Integration (70%)
- Location Services (60%)
- Initial Setup Flow (65%)

### Areas Still Needing Tests
- Audio Recording Stack
- Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech
- SwiftUI Views (Snapshot tests)
- Network error scenarios

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Audio Stack Testing**
   - Mock AVAudioEngine
   - Test recording states
   - Buffer management

2. **UI Testing**
   - Snapshot tests for views
   - Accessibility testing
   - Dark mode validation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Memory leak detection
   - Concurrent operation stress tests
   - Large data set handling

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Run all tests on every PR
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail builds under 70% coverage

2. **Test Maintenance**
   - Update tests with each feature change
   - Regular test refactoring
   - Documentation updates

3. **Mock Framework**
   - Consider adopting a mocking framework
   - Standardize mock implementations
   - Share mocks across tests

## 📝 Notes

- All tests use proper async/await patterns
- Thread safety is validated where applicable
- Tests are isolated and can run in parallel
- Mock implementations are lightweight and focused
- Integration tests validate real user workflows
