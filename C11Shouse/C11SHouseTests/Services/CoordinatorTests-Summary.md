# Unit Test Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created comprehensive unit tests for the three new coordinator classes that were extracted from ConversationView as part of Phase 2 refactoring.

## Test Files Created

### 1. QuestionFlowCoordinatorTests.swift
Tests the question progression and answer management logic.

**Key Test Areas:**
- `loadNextQuestion()` - Tests question loading with various states (unanswered, all answered, errors)
- `getCurrentAnswer()` - Tests retrieving existing answers
- `saveAnswer()` - Tests full integration flow including:
  - Name question handling with user name updates
  - Address question handling with parsing and saving
  - House name question handling
  - Prevention of duplicate saves
  - Error handling
- `saveAnswer(basic)` - Tests the basic save method with validation
- `isQuestionAnswered()` - Tests checking question completion status
- `getAnswer()` - Tests retrieving answers by question text
- `handleQuestionChange()` - Tests question transition logic including:
  - Address detection for address questions
  - House name generation
  - Pre-population of existing answers
- Notification handling for "AllQuestionsComplete"
- Thread safety and async/await patterns

**Mock Dependencies:**
- MockNotesService - Full implementation of NotesServiceProtocol
- MockConversationStateManager - Tracks method calls and state
- MockConversationRecognizer - Verifies thought setting
- MockAddressManager - Simulates address detection/parsing

### 2. ConversationStateManagerTests.swift
Tests the conversation state management including transcripts and TTS coordination.

**Key Test Areas:**
- User name loading and persistence
- Transcript management:
  - `startNewRecordingSession()` - Session initialization
  - `updateTranscript()` - First and subsequent updates
  - `clearTranscript()` - Complete reset
- TTS coordination:
  - Speaking when not muted
  - Respecting mute state
  - Preventing speech during saves
  - Handling speech interruptions
  - House thought speaking with suggestions
- Session state management
- Editing mode transitions
- Display name formatting
- Answer saving state tracking
- Full conversation flow integration test

**Mock Dependencies:**
- MockNotesService - For user name persistence
- MockTTSServiceForStateManager - Tracks TTS calls and simulates speaking

### 3. AddressManagerTests.swift
Tests address detection, parsing, and persistence logic.

**Key Test Areas:**
- `detectCurrentAddress()` - Tests with various permission states:
  - Authorized (WhenInUse/Always)
  - Denied
  - Not Determined
  - Location service errors
  - Geocoding errors
- `parseAddress()` - Tests address parsing:
  - With detected coordinates
  - Without coordinates
  - Invalid formats
- House name generation:
  - From full addresses
  - From street names only
  - Various street formats
- `saveAddress()` - Tests persistence to:
  - UserDefaults
  - LocationService
  - NotesService with metadata
  - Automatic house name generation
  - Preservation of existing house names
- `loadSavedAddress()` - Tests loading from UserDefaults
- Error handling for all failure modes
- Full integration test of complete address flow

**Mock Dependencies:**
- MockNotesService - For address and house name persistence
- MockLocationServiceForAddressManager - Simulates location detection and geocoding

## Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Async/Await Testing
All tests properly handle async methods using Swift's modern concurrency:
```swift
func testAsyncMethod() async throws {
    // Given
    // When
    let result = await sut.asyncMethod()
    // Then
    XCTAssertEqual(result, expected)
}
```

### 2. Mock Isolation
Each coordinator is tested in isolation with comprehensive mocks that:
- Track method call counts
- Verify parameters passed
- Control return values and errors
- Simulate realistic behavior

### 3. Error Testing
Comprehensive error testing using do-catch patterns:
```swift
do {
    try await sut.methodThatThrows()
    XCTFail("Expected error")
} catch ExpectedError.specificCase {
    // Success
} catch {
    XCTFail("Wrong error: \(error)")
}
```

### 4. Publisher Testing
Tests for @Published properties verify main thread updates:
```swift
let expectation = expectation(description: "Published update")
sut.$publishedProperty
    .dropFirst()
    .sink { value in
        XCTAssertTrue(Thread.isMainThread)
        expectation.fulfill()
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

### 5. Integration Testing
Each test file includes integration tests that verify the complete flow through the coordinator.

## Coverage Areas

- ✅ All public methods tested
- ✅ Error conditions handled
- ✅ Thread safety verified
- ✅ State transitions validated
- ✅ Integration points mocked
- ✅ Edge cases covered
- ✅ Async/await patterns used correctly

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all coordinator tests
xcodebuild test -scheme C11SHouse -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:C11SHouseTests/QuestionFlowCoordinatorTests
xcodebuild test -scheme C11SHouse -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:C11SHouseTests/ConversationStateManagerTests
xcodebuild test -scheme C11SHouse -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:C11SHouseTests/AddressManagerTests

# Or run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme C11SHouse -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

## Notes

- All tests follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern with Given/When/Then comments
- Mock objects are prefixed with "Mock" for clarity
- Test methods are descriptive and follow Swift naming conventions
- Tests are isolated and can run in any order
- No test depends on external state or network calls
