# Test Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-16

### Compilation Errors Fixed

1. **MockNotesService Duplication Error**
   - **Issue**: `MockNotesService` was defined in both `AddressManagerTests.swift` and `QuestionFlowCoordinatorTests.swift`, causing "Invalid redeclaration" and "ambiguous for type lookup" errors
   - **Fix**: Modified both test files to extend `SharedMockNotesService` from `TestMocks.swift` instead of redefining the class
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `AddressManagerTests.swift`
     - `QuestionFlowCoordinatorTests.swift`

### Test Failures Fixed

2. **AddressParserTests Failures**
   - **Issue**: `testExtractStreetName_OnlyStreetSuffix` and `testGenerateHouseName_OnlyStreetSuffix` expected empty string when input is only a street suffix, but got the suffix itself
   - **Fix**: Added check in `extractStreetName` to return empty string when input is only a suffix
   - **File Modified**: `AddressParser.swift`

3. **AddressManagerTests.testFullAddressFlowIntegration**
   - **Issue**: Test expected 2 calls to `saveNote` but was getting 0
   - **Fix**: Changed assertion to check `saveOrUpdateNoteCallCount` instead of `saveNoteCallCount` since AddressManager uses `saveOrUpdateNote`
   - **File Modified**: `AddressManagerTests.swift`

4. **NotesService+Questions.isQuestionAnswered**
   - **Issue**: Test expected `isQuestionAnswered` to return false for empty answers, but implementation only checked if note exists
   - **Fix**: Modified implementation to check `note.isAnswered` property which validates non-empty answers
   - **File Modified**: `NotesService+Questions.swift`

5. **NotesServiceQuestionsTests.testGetCurrentQuestion**
   - **Issue**: Test failed because `getCurrentQuestion` uses `questionsNeedingReview()` which requires `updated_via_conversation` metadata
   - **Fix**: Added `metadata: ["updated_via_conversation": "true"]` to all `saveOrUpdateNote` calls in tests
   - **File Modified**: `NotesServiceQuestionsTests.swift`

### Remaining Issues

The following test failures are in archived tests or require more investigation:
- ConversationFlowIntegrationTests (archived)
- InitialSetupFlowTests (archived)
- NotesServiceTests.testConcurrentSaveOperations (may need thread safety in mock)
- ErrorViewTests.testErrorToUserFriendlyConversion

### Recommendation

Since Xcode is not available in this environment, the tests should be run in the actual iOS development environment to verify all fixes work correctly. The main compilation errors have been resolved, and the critical test logic has been corrected.
