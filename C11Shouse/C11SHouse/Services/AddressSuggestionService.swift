/*
 * CONTEXT & PURPOSE:
 * AddressSuggestionService provides intelligent address suggestions during onboarding.
 * It uses location detection to pre-populate addresses and generates creative house names
 * based on street names. This creates a magical user experience where the app seems to
 * already know what the user wants.
 *
 * DECISION HISTORY:
 * - 2025-07-11: Initial implementation
 *   - Pre-populates detected address for user confirmation
 *   - Generates creative house name suggestions based on street
 *   - Works with ConversationStateManager to populate transcript
 *   - Integrates with weather service after address confirmation
 *
 * FUTURE UPDATES:
 * - [Placeholder for future changes - update when modifying the file]
