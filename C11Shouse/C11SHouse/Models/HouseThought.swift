/*
 * CONTEXT & PURPOSE:
 * HouseThought represents a conscious thought from the house's AI system. It encapsulates
 * the house's observations, insights, or suggestions about the current context, providing
 * a personality-driven interface for the house consciousness to communicate with users.
 *
 * DECISION HISTORY:
 * - 2025-07-07: Initial implementation
 *   - Struct-based model for value semantics and SwiftUI compatibility
 *   - Emotion state to reflect house's current feeling
 *   - Thought content as the main message
 *   - Context for understanding what triggered the thought
 *   - Confidence level to indicate certainty
 *   - Timestamp for tracking when thoughts occurred
 *   - Codable for persistence and API communication
 *   - Identifiable for SwiftUI list handling
 *   - Category to classify different types of thoughts
 *   - Optional suggestion for actionable insights
 *
 * FUTURE UPDATES:
 * - [Add future changes and decisions here]
