  # üöÄ SWARM EXECUTION: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet

  You are the SWARM ORCHESTRATOR. **IMMEDIATELY SPAWN 5 AGENTS** to execute: **review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet**

  ## üß† MEMORY SYSTEM - USE FOR ALL COORDINATION

  **EVERY AGENT MUST USE MEMORY TO:**
  1. Store detailed summaries after EACH step
  2. Save all findings, code, decisions, and results
  3. Enable cross-agent coordination

  **MEMORY COMMANDS:**
  - `Memory.store("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/agent/step", data)` - Store results
  - `Memory.get("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/agent/step")` - Retrieve data
  - `Memory.query("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095")` - Search all swarm data
  - `Memory.list({ namespace: "swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095" })` - List all entries

  **REQUIRED AFTER EACH STEP:**
  ```javascript
  // Example: After completing any task or step
  Memory.store("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/architect/requirements-analysis", {
    step: "Requirements Analysis",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    objective: "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet",
    findings: {
      requirements: ["req1", "req2", "req3"],
      constraints: ["constraint1", "constraint2"],
      decisions: ["decision1", "decision2"]
    },
    implementation: {
      code: "// actual code here",
      config: { /* actual config */ }
    },
    nextSteps: ["step1", "step2"],
    blockers: [],
    progress: "25%"
  });
  ```

  ## üéØ SPARC METHODOLOGY - EXECUTE WITH MEMORY

  ### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SPECIFICATION (TodoWrite) - START IMMEDIATELY
  ```javascript
  TodoWrite([
    {
      id: "swarm_objective",
      content: "Execute: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet",
      status: "in_progress",
      priority: "critical",
      agents: 5
    },
    {
      id: "agent_tasks",
      content: "Define specific tasks for 5 agents",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]);

  // SAVE SPECIFICATION TO MEMORY
  Memory.store("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/orchestrator/specification", {
    step: "Specification",
    objective: "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet",
    agents: 5,
    strategy: "auto",
    tasks: [/* list all tasks */]
  });
  ```

  ### 2Ô∏è‚É£ PSEUDOCODE - SPAWN EXACTLY 5 AGENTS NOW
  ```javascript
  // YOU MUST SPAWN EXACTLY 5 AGENTS - NO MORE, NO LESS

  // Auto strategy - Analyze objective and spawn 5 specialized agents
  Task("Lead Coordinator", "Coordinate execution of: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet");
  Task("Requirements Analyst", "Break down requirements for: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet");
  Task("Solution Architect", "Design solution for: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet");
  Task("Implementation Specialist", "Implement core components for: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet");
  Task("Quality Assurance", "Validate and test: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet");

  // CRITICAL: You spawned 5 agents as required
  ```

  ### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ARCHITECTURE - BATCH TOOLS MANDATORY
  **EVERY AGENT MUST USE BATCH TOOLS:**
  - **Read**: Pass array of file paths, read ALL at once
  - **MultiEdit**: Edit multiple files in ONE operation
  - **Glob/Grep**: Run in parallel, not sequential
  - **Memory**: Store detailed results with key swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/<agent>/<task>

  ### 4Ô∏è‚É£ REFINEMENT - MEMORY INTEGRATION
  Each agent MUST save to Memory:
  ```javascript
  Memory.store("swarm-auto-centralized-1751039990095/agent-name/task", {
    objective: "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet",
    agent: "agent-name",
    results: { /* concrete deliverables */ },
    code: { /* actual implementation */ },
    decisions: ["why", "what", "how"],
    nextSteps: ["specific", "actionable", "items"]
  });
  ```

  ### 5Ô∏è‚É£ COMPLETION - DELIVER RESULTS
  Success when:
  - ALL 5 agents have completed their tasks
  - Each agent saved concrete results to Memory
  - "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet" is DONE, not just planned

  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. SPAWN EXACTLY 5 AGENTS (you MUST spawn 5, not 4 or 51)
  2. USE BATCH TOOLS ONLY (no single file operations)
  3. SAVE TO MEMORY (every agent, every task)
  4. EXECUTE "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet" (deliver results, not plans)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to act as the SWARM ORCHESTRATOR and execute the task: "review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD, don't implement any code yet".

  I need to:
  1. First create the TodoWrite list for tracking this swarm execution
  2. Read the README.md file to understand what needs to be planned
  3. Spawn exactly 5 agents to work on this task
  4. Use Memory to store coordination data

  Let me start by setting up the todo list and reading the README.md.

‚óè I'll execute this swarm operation to review the README.md and create a detailed technical implementation plan using TDD methodology.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òê Execute: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD

     ‚òê Create /plans directory for technical documentation

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Great, I've set up the todo list. Now I need to:
  1. Read the README.md file first to understand what needs to be planned
  2. Then spawn exactly 5 agents to work on creating the technical implementation plan
  3. Create the /plans directory if it doesn't exist

  Let me start by reading the README.md and updating the todo for that task.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òê Execute: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD
     ‚òê Read and analyze README.md in root directory

     ‚òê Coordinate agent outputs into comprehensive TDD plan
     ‚òê Create /plans directory for technical documentation

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now let me read the README.md file to understand what we need to plan for.

‚óè Read(README.md)
  ‚éø  Read 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I understand the project scope. This is an iOS app that:
  1. Provides a voice-based interface
  2. Interfaces with a house consciousness system (https://github.com/adrianco/consciousness)
  3. Uses native Swift and Apple Intelligence features
  4. Need to check if the /plans directory exists and create it if not

  Let me check if the /plans directory exists, and then spawn the 5 agents to create a comprehensive technical implementation plan using TDD.

‚óè List(.)
  ‚éø  Listed 5 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The /plans directory doesn't exist yet. I need to create it. Let me update the todo and then create the directory before spawning the agents.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí Read and analyze README.md in root directory                                                                 
     ‚òê Execute: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD
     ‚òê Create /plans directory for technical documentation
     ‚òê Spawn 5 specialized agents for technical planning
     ‚òê Coordinate agent outputs into comprehensive TDD plan

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now let me create the /plans directory.

‚óè Bash(mkdir -p /workspaces/c11s-house-ios/plans)
  ‚éø  (No content)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Perfect! The /plans directory has been created. Now I need to update the todo and spawn exactly 5 agents to work on creating the technical implementation plan. Based on the project scope (iOS voice interface for house consciousness 
  system using Swift and Apple Intelligence), I should spawn agents with specialized expertise in:

  1. iOS Architecture Specialist - Design the overall app architecture
  2. Apple Intelligence & Voice Interface Expert - Plan voice interaction and AI features
  3. API Integration Specialist - Plan integration with the consciousness system APIs
  4. TDD & Testing Strategist - Define test-driven development approach
  5. Technical Documentation Lead - Coordinate and structure the planning documents

  Let me update the todo and spawn these agents.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí Read and analyze README.md in root directory                                                                 
     ‚òí Create /plans directory for technical documentation
     ‚òê Execute: review the README.md in root and create a detailed technical implementation plan in /plans using TDD
     ‚òê Spawn 5 specialized agents for technical planning
     ‚òê Coordinate agent outputs into comprehensive TDD plan

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I need to spawn exactly 5 agents. Each agent should have a specific role in creating the technical implementation plan for this iOS voice interface app. I'll spawn them all at once using the Task tool.

‚óè Now spawning 5 specialized agents to create a comprehensive TDD-based technical implementation plan:
